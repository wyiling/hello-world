    "For this assignment you will use the **crx.csv** dataset.  This is a public dataset that can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval). You should use the CSV file on my data site, at this location: [crx.csv](https://data.heatonresearch.com/data/t81-558/crx.csv) because it includes column headers.  This is a dataset that is usually used for binary classification. There are 15 attributes, plus a target column that contains only + or -.  Some of the columns have missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment you will train a neural network and return the predictions.  You will submit these predictions to the **submit** function.  See [Assignment #1](https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/blob/master/assignments/assignment_yourname_class1.ipynb) for details on how to submit an assignment or check that one was submitted.\n",

    "Complete the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your task is to replace missing values in columns *a2* and *a14* with values estimated by a neural network (one neural network for *a2* and another for *a14*).\n",
    "* Your submission file will contain the same headers as the source CSV: *a1*, *a2*, *s3*, *a4*, *a5*, *a6*, *a7*, *a8*, *a9*, *a10*, *a11*, *a12*, *a13*, *a14*, *a15*, and *a16*.\n",
    "* You should only need to modify *a2* and *a14*.\n",
    "* Neural networks can be much more powerful at filling missing variables than median and mean.\n",
    "* Train two neural networks to predict *a2* and *a14*.  \n",
    "* The y (target) for training the two nets will be *a2* and *a14*, depending on which you are trying to fill.\n",
    "* The x for training the two nets will be 's3','a8','a9','a10','a11','a12','a13','a15'.  These are chosen because it is important not to use any columns with missing values, also it could cause unwanted bias if we include the ultimate target (*a16*).\n",
    "* ONLY predict new values for missing values in *a2* and *a14*.\n",
    "* You will likely get this small warning:  Warning: The mean of column a14 differs from the solution file by 0.20238937709643778. (might not matter if small)\n",
